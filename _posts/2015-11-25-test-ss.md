# ICPatternLock
  ICPatternLock is a screen lock for your app access. It's familiar to most people and intuitively clear, 
  because a pattern is much more easy to remember.
  What is more, it's also convenient for developers to use, of course, and to extend.

 Pod is supported, try to add this to your `Podfile` </br>
 `pod 'ICPatternLock', :git => 'https://github.com/IvanChan/ICPatternLock.git'`
 
Convenience Usage
-----
  If you don't care much about the view display and some interactions, just use the `ICPatternLockManager` to present the pattern
  lock and receive the result.
  Of cource you can cusomize your GUI(e.g. color & text & preference) in this way. 
  </br>All what you need to do is just run your logic in the callback block.
  </br>Check out the `Demo Project` to experience this.

###To configure your pattern at the first time
  ```
  if ([ICPatternLockManager isPatternSetted])
    {
        UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Hint"
                                                        message:@"Pattern already setted"
                                                       delegate:nil
                                              cancelButtonTitle:@"OK"
                                              otherButtonTitles:nil];
        [alert show];
    }
    else
    {
        [ICPatternLockManager showSettingPatternLock:self
                                            animated:YES
                                        successBlock:^(ICPatternLockViewController *controller){
            
                                            dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(0.5 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                                                
                                                [controller dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
                                            });
                                        }];
    }
  ```
###Verify the pattern you previously set
  ```
  [ICPatternLockManager showVerifyPatternLock:self
                                           animated:YES
                                     forgetPwdBlock:^(ICPatternLockViewController *controller){
                                         
                                         NSLog(@"OMG~ forgot my pattern!~");
                                     }
                                       successBlock:^(ICPatternLockViewController *controller){
                                           
                                           dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(0.5 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                                               
                                               [controller dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
                                           });
                                       }];
  ```
###Modify the pattern
  ```
        [ICPatternLockManager showModifyPatternLock:self
                                           animated:YES
                                       successBlock:^(ICPatternLockViewController *controller) {
                                           
                                           dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(0.5 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                                               
                                               [controller dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
                                           });
                                           
                                       }];
  ```
  
### Customize Resource & Preference
 Use api below to custom your own resource (text display & color) & preference (e.g. node size, key table)
 </br> All key is defined in `PLPreferencesKeyDef.h` `PLResourceTextKeyDef.h` `PLResourceColorKeyDef.h`
 </br> Change all the value or maybe just one of them if you like.
```
#pragma mark - Resource Bridge
+ (void)loadTextResource:(NSDictionary *)textInfo;
+ (void)loadColorResource:(NSDictionary *)colorInfo;

#pragma mark - Preferences
- (void)setPreferencesValue:(id)value forKey:(NSString *)key;

#pragma mark - PatternHandler
+ (void)setCustomizedPatternHandler:(id<ICPatternHandlerProtocol>)handler;
```

Flexible Usage
-----
 If you want to assemble this to your own logic, using `ICPatternLockViewController` directly, it has enough api for user.
 </br>What's more, you can use `ICPatternLockView` to achive other goal if you like, imagination has no endÔºÅ
