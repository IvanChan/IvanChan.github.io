<p>ICPatternLock is a screen lock for your app access. It's familiar to most people and intuitively clear, because a pattern is much more easy to remember. What is more, it's also convenient for developers to use, of course, and to extend.</p>

<p>This is a command-line utility for examining the Objective-C runtime information stored in Mach-O files. It generates declarations for the classes, categories and protocols. This is the same information provided by using ‘otool -ov’, but presented as normal Objective-C declarations, so it is much more compact and readable.</p>
